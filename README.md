# B9lab Week8 Small Project

This project was built using truffle. The frontend is based on the default MetaCoin frontend created when running "truffle init".

This is in principle the same as b9lab-wk3_small_project modified to use Oraclize. It's not done yet but gives a general idea on how to use Oraclize.
